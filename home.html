Example: ER Diagrams (Entity Relationship Diagrams). <br> 3) Physical design. Defined as: <br>                                            &nbsp;&nbsp;a) How users add information to the system and how the system represents information back to the user. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;b) How the data is modelled and stored within the system. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;c)

                                            The product development process encompasses all steps needed to take a product from concept to market availability. This includes identifying a market need, researching the competitive landscape, conceptualizing a solution, developing a product roadmap,
                                            building a minimum viable product, etc. Because they are ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the company’s products, product managers typically drive the product development process from a strategic
                                            standpoint. But this process is not strictly a product management function. Product development requires the work and input of many teams across a business.

                        <p><strong>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</strong></p>
                        <p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates

                            fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides
                            no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services,

                        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information,

                        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such

                        <p><strong>Severability</strong></p>
                        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the
